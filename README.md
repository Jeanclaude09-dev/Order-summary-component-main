### What I learned

With this, I learned how to put correctly a background-image

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: url();
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to work more on the responsiveness, I had hard time making the card fit inside the body because the body was not covering the entire screen
